\title{Decompose stratum predictions into additive (fixed) and excess (random)}
\usage{
decompose_strata(object_additive, type = c("link", "response"))
}
\arguments{
\item{object_additive}{A "maihda" object for the additive model (Model B).}

\item{type}{"link" or "response". On response scale, excess is reported as
a difference: total_prob - additive_prob (nonlinear).}
}
\value{
tibble with .stratum, additive_eta/excess_eta/total_eta and (if response) prob columns.
}
\description{
Use an ADDITIVE MAIHDA model (e.g., \code{y ~ main_effects + (1|.stratum) + (1|region)} if contexts are present) ...
\itemize{
\item additive_eta: fixed-part prediction by stratum (re.form = NA, link scale)
\item excess_eta  : random intercept for the stratum (BLUP on link scale)
\item total_eta   : additive_eta + excess_eta
And (optionally) probabilities on response scale.
}
